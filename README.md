Hide Dash
=========

The gnome-shell-extension hide-dash is a simple extension that hides the dash
from the activities overview. 

If you find you don't use the dash or have a smaller screen you can use this
extension to hide the dash and allow the windows and application tabs to have a
close to full-screen area.

        git clone git://github.com/zacbarton/gnome-shell-extension-hide-dash.git '~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/hide-dash@zacbarton.com'
